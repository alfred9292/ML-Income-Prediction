# ML-Income-Prediction
Apply Random Forest, XGBoost and SVM for binary classification on income given various factors.



The problem we want to solve in this Census Income Dataset is designing an
efficient and effective classifier to find the most crucial factors that influence the level of income. The
findings could be a valued asset for further social sciences studies in the near future
